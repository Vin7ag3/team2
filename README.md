Ensure the UI/UX design is user-friendly and accessible.
2. Front-end Development:
Set up the project structure using HTML and Bootstrap/CSS
Implement the home page with pet listings and search functionality.
Create a search bar and filters for pet listings.
Develop a responsive design to ensure the app works well on various devices and screen sizes.
3. Integration with Server-side APIs:
Research and select APIs for pet listings, shelter information, and pet care tips. APIs like Petfinder, RescueGroups, or local shelter APIs.
Implement API calls to fetch and display pet listings.

Perform cross-browser testing to ensure compatibility with major web browsers (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).
7. Deployment to GitHub
Create separate branches for us to work on specific tasks or features.
Use pull requests (PRs) for code reviews and merging changes into the main branch.
Continuously update the main branch by pulling and pushing branches.
Perform thorough testing on the development/staging branch.
Deploy the stable application to production after successful testing.
